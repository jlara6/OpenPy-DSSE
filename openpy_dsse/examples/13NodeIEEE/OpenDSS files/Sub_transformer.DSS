!SUB TRANSFORMER DEFINITION 
! Although this data was given, it does not appear to be used in the test case results
! The published test case starts at 1.0 per unit at Bus 650. To make this happen, we will change the impedance
! on the transformer to something tiny by dividing by 1000 using the DSS in-line RPN math
