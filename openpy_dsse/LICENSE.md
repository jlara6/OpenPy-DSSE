# py_open_dsse
py_open_dsse is an application for state estimation in distribution systems, developed within the OpenREiD project (Integral software for simulation and optimization of electrical distribution networks), of the Instituto de Energía Eléctrica (IEE), UNSJ - CONICET, San Juan - Argentina. 

## Version 0.1.1
This first beta version allows to performance state estimation in single-phase distribution systems with nonlinear methods with and without phasor and linear measurements. In the case of multiphase networks, the positive sequence equivalent is obtained and the estimated state is obtained with a nonlinear method with or without phasor measurements. 

## Source Code
All the source code of the py_open_dsse tool is accessible and distributed compressed in ZIP and is available in the GitHub and SourceForge repositories.
