    "State estimation is a procedure to obtain an estimate of the operating point of the system defined by the state vector by processing a set of measurements and taking advantage of redundancy to refine and obtain an optimal estimate. This is achieved by applying maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), where it is assumed that the set of measurements $z_{1},z_{2},....., z_{m}$ has measurement errors with a known probability density function $N(μ_i,σ^2)$. The MLE problem, is obtained by solving the minimization problem:\n",

The mean $$mu _{i}$, or expected value $E(z_{i})$, can be expressed as a nonlinear function $h_{i}(x)$ that relates the state vector $x$ to the measurement $z_{i}$. The square of each residual $r_{i}^2$ is weighted with the weight of the measurement $z_{i}$ is $W_{ii}=\\left ( \\frac{1}{\\sigma ^{2}} \\right )$ reciprocal of the error variance. The minimization problem of (Eq. 1) is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the square of the residuals or solving the optimization problem for the state vector $x$ with an objective function:\n",
